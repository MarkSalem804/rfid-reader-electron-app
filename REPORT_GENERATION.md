    "currentlyParked": 5,
    "totalVehicles": 25,
    "parkingUtilization": 20
  },
  "sections": {
    "daily": [...],
    "vehicles": [...],
    "parking": [...]
  }
}
```

### Daily Report

```json
{
  "type": "daily",
  "dailyStats": [
    {
      "date": "2025-01-16",
      "totalEntries": 10,
      "totalExits": 8,
      "uniqueVehicles": 7,
      "averageDuration": 45
    }
  ]
}
```

### Vehicle Report

```json
{
  "type": "vehicle",
  "vehicleStats": [
    {
      "plateNo": "ABC123",
      "vehicleName": "Service Vehicle 1",
      "totalEntries": 15,
      "totalExits": 14,
      "totalDuration": 1200,
      "averageDuration": 85,
      "lastEntry": "2025-01-16T09:00:00.000Z",
      "lastExit": "2025-01-16T17:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Testing

Run the test file to verify functionality:

```bash
node test-report.js
```

## Styling

The report interface uses responsive CSS with:

- Clean, modern design
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Interactive tables
- Loading and error states
- Export button states

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. **Charts and Graphs**: Visual data representation
2. **Scheduled Reports**: Automatic report generation
3. **Email Reports**: Send reports via email
4. **Custom Date Ranges**: Predefined ranges (week, month, quarter)
5. **Report Templates**: Customizable report layouts
6. **Data Filtering**: Filter by vehicle type, department, etc.
7. **Real-time Updates**: Live report updates
8. **Report History**: Save and retrieve previous reports

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No data in reports**: Ensure vehicles are registered and have time logs
2. **Export not working**: Check browser download settings
3. **Date range issues**: Verify date format and range validity
4. **Performance issues**: Large date ranges may take time to process

### Error Messages

- **"Error generating report"**: Check database connection and data integrity
- **"No report to export"**: Generate a report before attempting export
- **"Invalid date range"**: Ensure start date is before end date
